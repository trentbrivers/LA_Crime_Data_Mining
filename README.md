# Trends & Analysis of Crime in Los Angeles:  Insights from Open Data from 2010 to Present
Using the Crime Data from 2010 to 2019 and Crime Data from 2020 to Present datasets for the city of Los Angeles, found on Data.gov, analyses were conducted to determine trends and relationships within the data.

Summary of Research Questions: 
1. What is the overarching trend in LA crime data over time?
Crime is increasing over time in the city.

2. Does seasonality impact crime?
Yes. We can see that crime decreases across the Winter months to a minimum in February before increasing again across the Spring and Summer to a peak in the months between July and October. 

3. What is the connection between victim demography and crime?
There are not specific groups that fall victim to specific crimes. Using K-Means clustering, a handful of groups were found to fall victim to a set of similar crimes. These include young Hispanic females 17-25, middle-aged Hispanic males 32-50, senior white males 56-70, and elderly white females.
